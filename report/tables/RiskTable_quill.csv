Ecosystem and environmental conditions,Assessment data inputs,Assessment model fits and structural uncertainty
"• There is limited information on factors affecting quillback recruitment, habitat, prey and predators, and competitors.",• Catch reconstruction has uncertainty in some historical years due to periods of high and low estimates of sampled catch rates and when rockfish were not always sorted to species,Uncertainty in recruitment
,• Not captured in bottom trawl surveys. Indices based on fishery-dependent and other fishery-independent sources. Limited effect on population trends. ,Uncertainty in natural mortality
,• Age data is limited compared to some other groundfish species and primarily occurs in the most recent 5-10 years. Covers commercial sector and suitable for growth estimation. Young fish remain sparse.,Age data provide information on mean length-at-age and uncertainty around that
,• Fewer samples of length data from fishing in recent years due to non-retention,
,• Length and age data are generally fit well across many assumptions. ,
,• Species-specific maturity and fecundity with both being collected from most recent years,
,• Generally not a directly targeted species but most catch is landed.,
