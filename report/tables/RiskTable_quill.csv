Ecosystem and environmental conditions,Assessment data inputs,Assessment model fits and structural uncertainty
"• There is limited information on factors affecting quillback recruitment, habitat, prey and predators, and competitors.",• Catch reconstruction has uncertainty in some historical years due to periods of high and low estimates of sampled catch rates and when rockfish were not always sorted to species,• Composition and index data were generally well fit. 
,• Not captured in bottom trawl surveys. Indices based on fishery-dependent and other fishery-independent sources. Limited effect on population trends. ,• Recruitment and growth are estimated internally whereas natural mortality and steepness are based on priors. 
,• Age data is limited compared to some other groundfish species and primarily occurs in the most recent 5-10 years. Covers commercial sector and suitable for growth estimation. Young fish remain sparse.,• Profiles and jitters indicate the model is stable and that estimated parameters are genearlly well estimated. 
,• Fewer samples of length data from fishing in recent years due to non-retention,• Uncertainty in natural mortality estimates both in terms of uncertainty in longevity as well as limited information by which to clearly estimate value.
,• Length and age data are generally fit well across many assumptions. ,"• Uncertainty in recruitment, particularly the strength of recruitment deviations in the mid 1990s."
,• Species-specific maturity and fecundity with both being collected from most recent years,• Patterns of retrospective bias due to exclusion of age data over time.
,• Generally not a directly targeted species but most catch is landed.,
