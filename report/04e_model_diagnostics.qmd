## Model Diagnostics

<!-- If a range of model runs is used to characterize uncertainty, it is important to provide some qualitative or quantitative information about relative probability of each. If no statements about relative probability can be made, then it is important to state that all scenarios (or all scenarios between the bounds depicted by the runs) are equally likely.  
If possible, ranges depicting uncertainty should include at least three runs: (a) one judged most probable; (b) at least one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of lower current biomass levels; and (c) one that depicts the range of uncertainty in the direction of higher current biomass levels. The entire range of uncertainty should be carried through stock projections and decision table analyses.  -->

### Convergence

<!-- Convergence status and convergence criteria for the base-run model (or proposed base run). Randomization of starting parameter value run (e.g., jitter) results or other evidence of search for global best estimates.  -->

### Retrospective Analysis

<!-- Retrospective analysis, where the model is fitted to a series of shortened input data sets, with the most recent years of input data being dropped.  -->
 
<!-- Historical analysis (plot of actual estimates from current and previous assessments).  -->

### Likelihood Profiles

<!-- Evaluation of model parameters. Likelihood profile for the base model over key parameters (typically natural morality, stock-recruit steepness, and equilibrium recruitment, or R0). The profile should indicate all likelihood values for individual components (e.g., indices by survey, compositional data for each type and fleet).   -->
