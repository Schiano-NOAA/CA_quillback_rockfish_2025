# Appendix C: Regulations

The following figures represent the regulations history for California's saltwater recreational fishery and nearshore commercial fishery.

The recreational regions are defined base on the following latitudes: Northern ($42^\circ 00^\prime$ N lat. to $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat.), Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat. to $38^\circ 57^\prime$ N lat.), San Francisco ($38^\circ 57^\prime$ N lat. to $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N lat.), Central ($37^\circ 11^\prime$ N lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N lat.), Southern ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N lat. to US/Mexico border). Not all management areas have been consistently defined over time. The northern and southern management areas have remained the same. From 2001-2003 the Central management area was defined as $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N lat. In 2004 and again in 2024, the Central area was split into a North-Central and South-Central areas at $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N lat. In 2005, the regions from  $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N lat. were redefined. The North-Central encompasses $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N lat. to $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N lat., Monterey South-Central from $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N lat. to $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N lat., and Morro Bay South-Central from $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N lat.
