# Assessment model

## History of modeling approaches

`r Spp` was first assessed in 2010 using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) which is a data-limited approach that incorporates catch data with priors on select parameters including natural mortality, the ratio of fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield to natural mortality, current depletion, and the depletion at maximum sustainable yield to estimate overfishing status, but not overfished status [@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]. `r Spp` was assessed as a single coastwide stock to generate an overall OFL that was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N. Assuming that current depletion was at the management target on average (e.g. 40%), the 2010 assessment found that `r spp` had a 52% chance of experiencing overfishing coastwide. 

In 2021, quillback rockfish was assessed coastwide with separate catch and length-based (SS-CL) data moderate methods for each of the three states, Washington, Oregon and California. The portion of the stock in California was found to be overfished and was declared overfished by NMFS in december 2024 after California quillback rockfish was defined as a stock. The 2021 spawning output relative to unfished was estimated at 0.14.  The model fixed steepness at the prior of 0.72 and natural mortality at 0.057 per year, which corresonds to a maximum age of 95 years [@Langseth_quillback_2021]. 

The 2021 assessment was initially reviewed at the \gls{ssc} Groundfish Subcommittee Workshop in June 2021. The \gls{pfmc} delayed the adoption of the assessment at the June 2021 Council meeting and requested additional analyses that were presented during a follow-up meeting in August 2021. In Setpember 2021, the \gls{ssc} endorsed the assessment as the best scientific information available as a category 2 stock. The \gls{ssc} endorsed the assessment for use in stock status determination during the November 2021 Council meeting, after the Mop-Up Review Panel. The Council adopted the assessment and rebuilding analysis at the November 2021 meeting.
