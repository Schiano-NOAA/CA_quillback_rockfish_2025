## Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

<!-- Describe any special issues (e.g., unbalanced or questionable data, missing survey data) that complicate scientific assessment, questions about the best model scenario. -->

The primary area of uncertainty for this assessment is the parameters influencing population productivity and ultimately scale.  @sec-bridging provides a detailed progression of changes in spawning output and spawning output relative to unfished between the 2021 and present assessments.  Updating biological parameters and data had a large effect on results and had a much greater impact than other changes such as selectivity.  Updating the growth curve and natural mortality contributed to the large change in the degree of recovery in spawning output relative to unfished, while updating the fecundity relationship increased the scale of spawning output. The updates to growth and fecundity were derived from recent research that was unavailable at the time of the 2021 assessment.  This new research provides a considerable improvement in our understanding of `r spp` and ability to produce accurate assessments.  This highlights the importance of basic life history research and that continued work to refine these estimates and monitor for potential change over time is critical.  Despite these improvements, we still face uncertainty in population scale and hope to understand the reasons for differences in scale observed between this assessment and analysis of \gls{rov} survey data (see @sec-appendix-B).  

Catches of `r spp` were particularly high in a few years for both the recreational and commercial fleets. Although not affecting estimates of depletion, averaging out these high years of catches affected model scale and therefore estimates of sustainable yield. Changes to catches affecting model scale is true of all models that assume catch is well known, however for `r spp` in `r state` the magnitude of the reduction in catch for these years was approximately 20 percent of the total removals.
