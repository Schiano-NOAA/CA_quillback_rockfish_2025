## Model Structure and Assumptions (TOR Section E)

### Modeling Platform and Structure (TOR Section E5)

The assessment was conducted using Stock Synthesis version 3.30.23.1, compiled December 5, 2024 (available [online](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/ss3-source-code/releases/tag/v3.30.23.1)). The R package `r4ss`, version 1.52.0 [@r4ss_2021], along with R version 4.4.1
[@r_2024] were used to investigate and plot model fits. The base model is a single-sex (combined across sexes) and single-area model for the coast of California, though `r spp` are rarely caught south of Point Conception. The model includes two fishery fleets (commercial and recreational), two survey fleets (the \gls{s-ccfrp} hook and line survey, and \glspl{cdfw} \gls{rov} survey), and one growth fleet used to inform estimates of growth internal to the model as well as other population dynamics. The model begins in 1916, which is the earliest year of the commercial catch reconstruction. The population was assumed to be unfished and at an equilibrium age structure at this point.

### Model Changes from the Last Assessment (TOR Section E4)

A number of changes have been made in the base model compared to that used in the 2021 assessment [@Langseth_status_2021]. These involve changes in data, data sources used, and model assumptions. The change with the largest effect includes the addition of age data, both the use of commercial conditional-age-at-length distributions but also the inclusion of the growth fleet to support estimating growth internally in the model as well as other population dynamics. Most of these data was the result of extensive sampling efforts across multiple agencies since the 2021 assessment. The effect of the addition of this data on model results is shown in bridging (see @sec-bridging below) and through profiles (see @sec-profiles below), and the effect of omitting this data on model results was explored through sensitivity analyses (see @sec-assmt-sens below).

In general, the synthesis and treatment of data has been altered for this assessment based on updated best practices and extensive work by \gls{nwfsc} to document, reproduce, and standardize data processing steps, along with extensive work by staff at \gls{cdfw} and \gls{psmfc} in providing consistent and accurate data in a more easily obtainable manner. Documenting each change is unnecessary, as these are expected to be minor, but we do highlight changes in the processing of total removals. Changes in processing catch data include different approaches to filling in missing years for commercial landings in 1981--1983 (assumed zero for this assessment rather than interpolating from neighboring years), 1990--1992 (based on average of neighboring three years rather than interpolating nearest years); and inclusion of previously omitted quantitative by adding missing private/charter sampling for 1993--1995, and including estimates from recent recreational removals reported in numbers but not in weight. For discards, `r spp` in California are now separated out in the \gls{gemm} and therefore easier to add to commercial landings for obtaining total removals. The process for calculating historical dead discards resulted in a lower ratio of dead discards to landings for commercial data, and a different ratio (based on use of an alternative field) of dead discards to landings for recreational data.

New data sources were available for use in this assessment that were outside the scope of the data-moderate \gls{tor} for the 2021 assessment. Two fishery-independent data sources were added to this assessment, the \gls{s-ccfrp} and the \gls{cdfw} \gls{rov} surveys. Both of these surveys were developed to monitor fish inside the network of \glspl{mpa} as well as in adjacent areas open to fishing. The assessment also includes a fishery-dependent index of abundance from the recreational private/rental fleet. This is the first assessment for `r spp` to include age composition data to support estimates of growth and population dynamics within the base model. As such, ageing error is now included in this assessment. 

In addition to new data types such as age and survey data, new data sources not made at the time of the 2021 assessment were now available and used in this assessment. New sampling efforts since the 2021 assessment resulted in updated California-specific estimates for fecundity and maturity. The weight-length relationship was also updated using only California data. Historical length data for the recreational fleet from 1959--1960 was recovered from research conducted by Miller and Geibel [@miller1973fish] and Miller and Gotschall [@miller_ocean_1965], and more recent length data for the recreational fleet from 1992--1997 was made available by Miller and Collier [@geibel_prsurvey_2025]. These data were included in the length compositions in the base model.

Lastly, a number of alternative model assumptions were explored and ultimately used for the base model. These include alternative assumptions around maximum age and therefore natural mortality, alternative parameterization of dome-shaped selectivity curves (using three parameter rather than four parameter), and alternative years for blocking selectivity. In addition, data weighting was done according to the algorithm by @francis_data_2011 as opposed to @mcallister_bayesian_1997, which was the method used for the 2021 assessment. Sample sizes used for recreational sources were included as approximations of the number of trips as opposed to number of fish, which was done for the 2021 assessment.

### Bridging Analysis from the 2021 Data Moderate Assessment (TOR Section E4) {#sec-bridging}

The exploration of models began by bridging from the 2021 data moderate assessment model to the newest version of Stock Synthesis, version 3.30.23.1. Using the newest Stock Synthesis version resulted in no difference in spawning output than estimated in 2021 (@fig-bridgeSS3_bio). From there, bridging from the 2021 assessment model to the current base model followed three primary steps:

1. Update life history information to California-specific estimates including natural mortality, growth, length-weight, maturity, and fecundity. 
2. Update data inputs to reflect best scientific information currently available. Data was updated by data type (catch, compositions including length and age, and indices), which inherently meant updating data for fleets present in the 2021 assessment and then adding data from fleets added into the current base model that were in not the 2021 assessment.
3. Update selectivity blocks and shapes, and reapply data weighting practices.

To arrive at the final base model, additional revisions were made after these three steps to determine the best fit to the data and following standard practices. These included, but were not limited to, removing fits to composition data with small sample sizes, revisions to the recruitment bias adjustment, and final revisions to data weightings.

A thorough description of the current base model is presented separately below (@sec-base-results). This section is intended only to more clearly identify where substantive changes occurred during the bridging analysis. Sensitivities to some of the components within the steps above are included in @sec-assmt-sens.

Changes due to updating biological relationships are shown in @fig-bridgeBio_comp. Updating fecundity greatly increased spawning output, which is not surprising given the new curve assumed greater fecundity at larger sizes, but did not have a noticeable effect on spawning output relative to unfished, total biomass, or estimates of recruitment. Updating natural mortality reduced initial spawning output and increased recent spawning output, leading to a greater degree of recovery in spawning output relative to unfished. Updating growth parameters, which at this point in the bridging analysis were entered as fixed parameters and not estimated, also increased recent spawning output, but to a greater degree than natural mortality, resulting in the largest change in spawning output relative to unfished among individual steps. Both the fixed $L_{\infty}$ and $K$ values were lower than the fixed values used for the 2021 assessment, which were $L_{\infty}$ = 43.04 cm and $K$ = 0.199 [@Langseth_status_2021]. The pattern of change in population dynamics between the 2021 growth assumptions and the new fixed parameters, and between the values assumed for natural mortality were similar to the patterns based on sensitivities and profiles for these two relationships during the 2021 assessment. Collectively, updating the growth curve and natural mortality contributes to the large change in the degree of recovery in spawning output relative to unfished, while updating the fecundity relationship increases the scale of spawning output (though not the scale of ln($R_0$) or summary biomass). 

Changes due to updating data streams are shown in @fig-bridgeData_comp. Overall, updates to data resulted in less overall change in the estimated population trajectory than did updates to the biological relationships. Updating the fishery catch and length composition data resulted in decreased spawning output across all years such that spawning output relative to unfished conditions were minimally changed.  When age composition data were included, spawning output increased, and especially so in recent years. This occurred because of increased recruitment both in the largest recruitment event, estimated at 1996 during bridging and in 2012. When growth was allowed to be estimated, leading to a lower estimate of $K$ and larger estimate for $L_{\infty}$ similar to that from 2021, the rate of increase in spawning output relative to unfished decreases in recent years. The direction of the change in population trajectory with the change in growth parameters is consistent with the results of the profiles from the 2021 assessment for $L_{\infty}$ but opposite to the pattern observed in the profiles for $K$ [@Langseth_status_2021]. Estimating growth outside the assessment using samples that are not randomly selected can bias model results. Growth estimation internal to the model is preferred, although estimates may be influenced by other data types than just conditional age-at-length. Adding the index data, which includes \gls{s-ccfrp}, \gls{rov}, and the recreational private/rental index resulted in decreases in recent spawning output relative to other steps, driven primarily by lower recruitment in the peak year (estimated in 1996 during bridging). As was found in the biological bridging steps, biological relationships, including age data used in the estimation of growth, caused the largest changes in model trajectories. Collectively however, changes in data resulted in minimal impact on results compared to changes due to updating biological relationships.  

Changes due to updating how selectivity as well as reapplying data weighting procedures are shown in @fig-bridgeOther_comp. Overall, changes to selectivity from the 2021 assessment, which included changes to both the time blocks as well as to the form of selectivity (domed versus asymptotic) had limited effect on population trajectory. Spawning output increased when selectivity was updated, though changes in spawning output relative to unfished were minimal. A limited effect due to changes in selectivity choices is consistent with results from explorations done throughout the review process for the 2021 assessment [@Langseth_status_2021]. Alternative selectivity treatments were extensively explored during base model selection and are described in sensitivity analyses (see @sec-assmt-sens for details). Applying weighting procedures resulted in negligible changes in both spawning output and spawning output relative to unfished. 

To arrive at a final base model additional revisions to the model structure, selectivity blocks, and selectivity parameterization were explored in order to determine the best fit to the data.
