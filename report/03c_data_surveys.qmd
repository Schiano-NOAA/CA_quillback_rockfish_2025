## Fishery-independent data

<!-- Fishery-independent data: Description of surveys used in the assessment, description of methods to estimate abundance indices, sample size information for length- and age- composition data by survey and year, including both the number of tows (or drops or sites for hook and line data) and fish sampled. Include complete tables and figures and date of data extraction.   -->

### \acrlong{s-ccfrp}

Since 2007, the \gls{s-ccfrp} has monitored several areas in California to evaluate the performance of \glspl{mpa} and understand nearshore fish populations [@Wendt2009; @Starr2015]. In 2017, the survey expanded beyond the four \Gls{mpa}s in central California (A&ntilde;o Nuevo, Point Lobos, Point Buchon, and Piedras Blancas) to include the entire California coast. Fish are collected by volunteer anglers aboard \glspl{cpfv} guided by one of the following academic institutions based on proximity to fishing location: Humboldt State University; Bodega Marine Laboratories; Moss Landing Marine Laboratories; Cal Poly San Luis Obispo; University of California, Santa Barbara; and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

Surveys consist of fishing with hook-and-line gear for 30-45 minutes within randomly chosen 500 by 500 m grid cells within and outside \glspl{mpa}. Prior to 2017, all fish were measured for length and release or descended to depth; since then, some were sampled for otoliths and fin clips.  Length compositions and an index of relative abundance were applied to a \gls{s-ccfrp} survey fleet within the model.

### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design; covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55-1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011]. This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast. Two vessels fish from north to south during each pass between late May to early October. This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability, as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (approximately 700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.


### ROV survey

Statewide \gls{rov} survey data is available between 2014--2021.  The survey monitors Californiaâ€™s mid-depth habitats (30-100 m) and is a collaboration between \gls{cdfw} and Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE).  It was initially developed to assess the \gls{mpa} network.  Sampling has been conducted at \gls{mpa}s along the entire California coast with 500-meter transects conducted within rocky reef habitat inside and outside each \gls{mpa}. A full description of survey methods is available in @lauermann_rov_2017.  Data includes counts of fish by species, fish sizes, and a variety of characteristics of the transect location.  Length compositions and an index of relative abundance were applied to an \gls{rov} survey fleet within the model.  

### Fishery-independent abundance indices
An \gls{rov} survey relative abundance index was derived by \gls{cdfw} staff and the methods are described in Appendix B.  The index predictions for density inside and outside \gls{mpa}s are weighted by the estimated relative abundance of habitat in those areas.  Overall, it indicates a modest increase in abundance between 2015 and 2020 and the model trend is within the 95% uncertainty interval of the index values (**FROG Add figure reference**). The estimated density increase is larger inside \gls{mpa}s than outside.  Methods used to derive an abundance index from the CCFRP survey are described in Appendix C.  The index spans 2017--2024.  The lowest value occurs in 2019 and the highest in 2024, with an increasing trend since 2021.  The model trend is within the 95% uncertainty interval around index values in all years except the low value in 2019 (**FROG Add figure reference**).  

An additional effort was made by staff at the \gls{swfsc} to estimate an absolute abundance of `r spp` inside \gls{mpa}s from the \gls{rov} survey data.  Methods are described in (**FROG Do we have something to reference?**).  These estimates were used in sensitivity analyses described in section @sec-assmt-sens.  

### Fishery-independent length compositions
\gls{rov} length samples were available from 2014--2021.  A total of 282 of these samples were included for years with five or more samples (**FROG Table reference**).  Input sample sizes were equal to the total number of length samples.  Compositions were weighted according to their sample location and the percent of habitat inside (20) and outside (80) of MPAs.  Because the \gls{rov} is a visual survey, it is able to select smaller fish than the hook and line based data sets.  The length composition aggregated across all years shows a bimodal distribution with a mode of small fish between 10-25 cm (**FROG figure reference**). Annual length distribution residuals show a pattern  of increasing size between 2019--2021 @fig-len-comm-bubbles.  The average length of fish observed by the survey was highest in 2014, lowest in 2019, then increased through 2021 @fig-lenMean-rov.  Model predicted average length is within the 95% confidence interval of the annual mean lengths but does not reflect the increasing trend seen between 2019--2021 which may have been driven by recruitment patterns and the survey ability to detect small fish.  

\gls{s-ccfrp} length samples were available from 2017--2021.  A total of (**FROG how many?**) length samples were included for years with five or more samples (**FROG Table reference**).  Similar to the \gls{rov} data set, input sample sizes were equal to the total number of length samples and compositions were weighted according to their sample location and the percent of habitat inside (20) and outside (80) of MPAs.  The length composition aggregated across all years also shows a bimodal distribution that is distict from the \gls{rov} data and from the fishing fleets.  Both the \gls{rov} and \gls{s-ccfrp} surveys sample inside \gls{mpa}s and might be expected to select larger fish.  This is more evident in the \gls{s-ccfrp} data.  No strong patterns are evident in the annual length distribution residuals @fig-len-comm-bubbles.  The model predicted average length showing a slight declining trend is well fit by the \gls{s-ccfrp} average annual lengths @fig-lenMean-rov.
