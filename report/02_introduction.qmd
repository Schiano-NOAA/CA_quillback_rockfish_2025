# Introduction

This assessment reports the status of `r spp` (*Sebastes maliger*) off the coast of California through 2024. The \gls{pfmc} defined the California stock of `r spp` as part of the process to define stocks for management. Although the management definition for the California stock of `r spp` is statewide, the range of `r spp` in California is primarily north of central California (@fig-map).

## Life History

`r Spp` are a demersal, relatively nearshore species within the subgenus *Pteropodus*.  The body coloring of adult `r spp` is brown with yellow to orange blotching and light-colored dorsal saddle patches [@love_rockfishes_2002]. As their name suggests, `r spp` have long dorsal fin spines with deeply incised membranes. The availability of life history information for `r spp` in California is sparse. A number of studies were undertaken after the 2021 data-moderate `r spp` assessment to estimate growth, maturity and fecundity in the most southern part of their range.

The diet of `r spp` consists primarily of benthic and pelagic crustaceans, e.g., coonstripe shrimp, and fish, with the proportion of fish contributing to their diet increasing with size [@murie_comparative_1991]. The core range of `r spp` is relatively large from central California to the Gulf of Alaska, with `r spp` also found in Puget Sound. `r Spp` range from the sub-tidal (as juveniles) to depths of around 274 m [@love_rockfishes_2002]. `r Spp` are commonly found in waters less than 100 m  inhabiting both low and high relief complex rocky habitat [@love_milton_probably_1996] and do not show an ontogenetic migration that a number of rockfish exibit. [@murie_comparative_1991] (1991) found `r spp` of all sizes in shallower waters, and a lack of small `r spp` in deeper depths. This is similar to trends observed in the two fishery-independent studies used in this assessment, as well as biological data observed from the \gls{wcgop}. Adult `r spp` have high site fidelity; an acoustic telemetry study displaced `r spp` 500 m from the capture location and all returned to the original capture site within 30 days [@matthews_1990_telemetric]. Other telemetry studies have found similar patterns of high site fidelity as well as small home ranges for `r spp` [@hannah_site_fidelity_2011], [@tolimieri_home_2009]. 

Limited studies have evaluated genetic variation in `r spp` across the U.S. West Coast. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of `r spp` [@seeb_gene_1998; @Stoutetal_DPS_2001], however Seeb [-@seeb_gene_1998] did not find significant differentiation in populations of `r spp` between coastal Washington and Alaska. 

`r Spp` are a long-lived rockfish with the oldest aged specimen at 95 years from British Columbia [@love_rockfishes_2002; @YamanakaandLacko_rockfish_2001]. Along their range, the oldest `r spp` from southeast Alaska was 92 (pers. comm. ADFG), 73 from Washington (pers. comm. WDFW), 63 from Oregon (pers. comm. ODFW) and 57 from California, encountered by \gls{s-ccfrp}.  

[@cope_approach_2011] found `r spp` to have a vulnerability score of V = 2.222, making it a species of major concern in the productivity susceptibility analysis. This analysis calculated species specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history, and susceptibility characterized by how the stock is likely affected by fisheries. 


## Ecosystem Considerations

This stock assessment does not explicitly incorporate trophic interactions, habitat factors nor environmental factors into the assessment model, but a brief description of likely or potential ecosystem considerations is provided below.

As with most other rockfish and groundfish in the California Current, recruitment or cohort (year-class) strength appears to be highly variable for `r spp`, with only a modest apparent relationship to estimated levels of spawning output. Oceanographic and ecosystem factors are widely recognized to be key drivers of recruitment variability for most species of groundfish, as well as most elements of California Current food webs. 

## Historical and Current Fishery Information

`r Spp` is encountered in both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range. In waters off the coast of California, `r spp` is generally not a highly desirable species by recreational fishermen  and its value in the commercial fishery rose with the development of the live fish fishery. Recreational removals are the largest source of fishing mortality and represent approximately 70 percent of the total removals of `r spp` across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The majority of the commercial landings for `r spp` occurred between 1990 and 2008, with a small increase from 2016 to 2022 prior to the stock being defined and subsequently declared overfished. 

The groundfish fishery in the early part of the 20th century was focused on nearshore waters near ports, with expanded activity further from port and into deeper depths over time [@miller_spatially_2014]. Prior to the groundfish fishery being declared a federal disaster in 2000, and the subsequent rebuilding period, there were no time or area closures for groundfish. 

The California recreational fishery in the early part of the 1900s was focused on nearshore waters and closer to ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time. Prior to the groundfish fishery disaster being declared in 2000, there were no time or areas closures for fishing groundfish. During this period, access to deeper depths led to effort being spread over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from the shelf as well as the nearshore. This resulted in lower catch rates for nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when depth restrictions at a range of depths starting between 20 to 50 fathoms (fm) were put in place in various management areas north of Point Conception where `r spp` are commonly found. This shift of effort into the nearshore kept catch levels high for nearshore rockfish, including `r spp` (Figure \ref{fig:catch}), despite greatly reduced seasons.

Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from both the shelf and nearshore. This resulted in lower catch of nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000.  This shifting effort onto the nearshore, concomitantly increased catch rates for nearshore rockfish including `r spp` in the remaining open depths. California's network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) also closed approximately 20 to 27 percent of state waters to recreational fishing, with the majority of MPAs developed in 2007.

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live fish fishery during the 1980s and 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by a premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with the Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. In 2003, CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including the requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain `r spp`. Permits were issued based on prior landings history and the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level. The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April, and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from their low catch limits.  The open access fishery is allowed to retain shelf rockfish species co-occurring with nearshore rockfish species. There is growing concern regarding increased encounters and dicard mortality from the open access fleet, given that they are fishing in deeper depths. 


## Management History

Prior to 2000, the management of rockfish off the coast of California was limited.  The recreational bag limit (that included rockfish) was 20-fish from 1967 to 1970, 15-fish from 1970 to 2000 when it was reduced to the current day bag limit of 10 rockfish. The sub-bag limit for `r spp` did not change until 2022 when a 1-fish sub-bag limit was implemented to a full closure of the fishery in August, 2023.

Between 1999 and 2002, gear regulations went from unlimited hooks and lines to one line per person with no more than two hooks, the current 10 rockfish, cabezon, greenling (RCG) bag limit was enacted, and CDFW created  management areas to restricting fishing shoreward of depths between 20 to 60 fm. The latitudinal boundaries of the management areas and depth closures have fluctuated since 2002, but have remained fairly consistent from 2011-2022 (@fishing_regs_rec).  Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) instituted between 2003 and 2012 now encompass 20-30% of the rocky reef habitat within 3 miles of shore in state waters.

Prior to the adoption of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) in 1982, `r spp` were managed through a regulatory process that included the \gls{cdfw}, the California State Legislature, and the Fish and Game Commission (FGC). With implementation of the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP, `r spp` came under the management authority of the \gls{pfmc} and were managed as part of the *Sebastes* complex. Because `r spp` had not undergone rigorous stock assessment and did not compose a large fraction of the landings it was classified and managed as part of the "Minor Nearshore Rockfish" group [@pfmc_final_2008].

Since the early 1980s, a number of federal regulatory measures have been used to manage the commercial rockfish fishery including cumulative trip limits (generally for two- month periods) and seasons. Starting in 1994 the commercial groundfish fishery sector was divided into two components: limited entry and open access with specific regulations designed for each component. Limited entry programs were designed in part to limit bottom contact gears and the open access sector includes gears not making bottom contact, e.g., hook and line. Other regulatory actions for the general rockfish categories included area closures and gear restrictions set for the four different commercial sectors - limited entry fixed gear, limited entry trawl, open access trawl, and open access non-trawl (which includes the nearshore fishery). 

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major changes also occurred in the way that California managed its nearshore fishery. The Marine Life Management Act (MLMA), which was passed in 1998 by the California Legislature and enacted in 1999, required that the FGC adopt an FMP for nearshore finfish [@wilson-vandenberg_implementing_2014]. It also gave authority to the FGC to regulate commercial and recreational nearshore fisheries through FMPs and provided broad authority to adopt regulations for the nearshore fishery during the time prior to adoption of the nearshore finfish FMP. Within this legislation, the Legislature also included a requirement that commercial fishermen landing nearshore species possess a nearshore fishery permit.

In 2000, the PFMC's rockfish management structure changed significantly with the replacement of the *Sebastes* complex -north and -south areas with Minor Rockfish North (Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka, International North Pacific Fisheries Commission (INPFC) areas) and Minor Rockfish South (Monterey and Conception INPFC areas only). The optimum yield for these two groups was further divided (between north and south of Cape Mendocino, California) into nearshore, shelf, and slope rockfish categories with allocations set for Limited Entry and Open Access fisheries within each of these three categories. Species were parceled into these new categories depending on primary catch depths and geographical distribution. `r Spp` was included in the nearshore rockfish category. 

Following adoption of the Nearshore FMP and accompanying regulations by the FGC in fall of 2002, the FGC adopted regulations in November 2002 which established a set of \gls{mpa}s around the Channel Islands in southern California (which became effective April 2003). The FGC also adopted a restricted access program in December 2002 which established the Deeper Nearshore Species Fishery Permit, to be effective starting in the 2003 fishing year. Also, since the enactment of the MLMA, the PFMC and State coordinated to develop and adopt various management specifications to keep harvest within the harvest targets, including seasonal and area closures, depth restrictions, and bag limits to regulate the recreational fishery and license and permit regulations, finfish trap permits, gear restrictions, seasonal and area closures, depth restrictions, trip limits, and minimum size limits to regulate the commercial fishery. The MPAs were later expanded under authority of the Marine Life Protection Act (MLPA) enacted in 1999, creating a network of MPAs which went into place in phases beginning with the central coast in 2007, north central coast in 2010, and the south and north coasts in 2012. The implementation of the cowcod conservation area (CCA) in 2001 closed a large area of the Southern California Bight west of Santa Catalina and San Clemente Islands and offshore of San Diego. The CCA prohibited retention of groundfish, except for some take of nearshore species in depths less than 20 fm around islands and banks, and later, less than 40 fm. The rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) are seasonally adjusted depth limits impacting trawl and non-trawl gears that were initially established in 2002 to protect overfished species. The RCAs also restricted catch of nearshore species to depths less than 30 fm, and in some areas along California to less than 20 fm. Thus, the MPAs, CCAs and RCAs represent three types of spatial and/or depth closures impacting rockfish.

The state of California has adopted regulatory measures to manage the nearshore fishery based on the harvest guidelines set by the \gls{pfmc} for the minor nearshore rockfish complexes north and south of Cape Mendocino. The complexes are managed based on overfishing limits (OFL) and annual catch limits (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFLs and ACLs (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catches) contributions for all stocks managed in the complexes. Limits are shared among all commercial and recreational fleets with the various management procedures intended to maintain removals below the total OFL and ACL for the nearshore rockfish north and south complexes as a whole, rather than on a species by species basis. The nearshore commercial fishery is managed based on bimonthly allowable catches per vessel, that have ranged from 200 to 2,000 pounds per two months since 2000. The limited entry trawl fleet is managed using monthly limits set on an annual basis. Since 2011, the limit has been 300 pounds per month for non-IFQ species, such as nearshore rockfish.  **FROG - check these numbers.**

Since 2023 **CONFIRM THIS. It might have been since 2021** `r spp` in California were removed from the nearshore rockfish complex. 
**FROG: Add recent maangement history, ie stock defintiion in 2023 and then subsequent overfished declaration, as well as closures in 2024**.

## Management Performance

The species-specific OFL and ACL contribution for `r spp` that is allocated to California waters, Nearshore Rockfish South and 25 percent of the Nearshore Rockfish North, is shown in Table \ref{tab:ca-management} as well as the total catch, south and north of Point Conception in California combined, for the last ten years.  Over the last ten years the catches of `r spp` have been below the species-specific ACLs.

Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->

## Foreign Fisheries

`r Spp` does not extend south to Mexico and given that the stock is defined as California only we did not consider the fisheries in Alaska or Canada.
