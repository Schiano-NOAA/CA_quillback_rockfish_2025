## Base Model Results

### Parameter Estimates

A total of 121 parameters were estimated for the base model @tbl-n-param. The parameters, fixed and estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in @tbl-pars and the likelihood components are shown in @tbl-likelihood. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown  @tbl-timeseries. 

The log($R_0$) was estimated at `r round(mod_out$parameters['SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 3)`. The model estimated reasonable growth parameters and variability for 
$L_{age=2}$ = `r round(mod_out$parameters['L_at_Amin_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)` 
(CV = `r round(mod_out$parameters['CV_young_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`) and 
$L_{\infty}$ = `r round(mod_out$parameters['L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)` 
(CV = `r round(mod_out$parameters['CV_old_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`).  The $k$ parameter was esimtated as 
`r round(mod_out$parameters['VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`. The estimated $L_{\infty}$ is 0.29 cm smaller than the value it was fixed at for the 2021 assessment and $k$ is estimated to be lower than the 2021 fixed value of 0.199.

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets, and age-based selectivity of 1.0 starting at age 1 for the growth fleet (@fig-selex). Model explorations included parameterizing the fleets with double normal selectivity and explorations of time blocks. 

The survey fleets did not include time blocks and the double normal selectivity pattern was were fixed to asymptotic size selectivity.  The ROV survey observed a wider range of sizes than CCFRP.  The peak size for the ROV survey was estimated at
`r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_ROV(5)', 'Value'], 3)` cm and 
`r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_CCFRP(4)', 'Value'], 3)` cm for CCFRP.

The fishery selectivities were all well estimated estimated and fixed to be asymptotic except for the early time period of the commercial fleet that esimated the peak domed selectivity at `r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_Commercial(1)_BLK1repl_1916', 'Value'], 3)`, indicating preferential size selection during that period.

The catchability for each of the surveys was analytically solved comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. The analytical values for catchability were small given the survey methodologies and are reported in Table [-@tbl-pars] in log-space.

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures [-@fig-recruits] and [-@fig-rec-devs].  The strongest recruitment event occurred in 1994 and was followed by a period of lower than average recruitment until 2010, after which the recuirtment pattern has been cyclical. Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in 2024 @fig-bh-curve. The early recruitment deviations were all negative

### Fits to the Data

#### Fits to length and age composition

The aggregated fits to the length composition are reasonable [@fig-lenfit-all] given the overall sparcity of data and variable sample sizes by year [@fig-len-pearson-all].


The mean lengths observed by year from the commercial fleet were uncertain but the time-varying selecitivty captures the changes in mean length relatively well in all but one year, 2007 [@fig-meanlen-comm]. The commercial lengths samples from 2010--2014 only represent the two most northern ports, but there were not regulatory changes that supported the observed patter in increasing length. There were limited aged available for the commercial fleet from a limited number of years. There are a few remaining large Pearson residuals in individual years, but the mean age from the conditional data were well captured by the model [@fig-age-pearson-comm and @fig-meanage-comm].

There were no ages available from the recreational fleet collect as part of the CDFW \gls{crfs} sampling program. The model fit the tails of the aggregated recreational length composition well, but expected a peak length larger than the data suggested [@fig-lenfit-all].  For years in which the large sample sizes of recreational lengths the data were well fit. The Pearson residuals were variable by year and no patterns of general misfit are visible. The mean length in the recreational fishery was more uncertain prior to 1993 [@fig-meanlen-rec].  The mean length in 1983 was not fit with marked higher Pearson residuals for lareger fish in the early 1980s.  There were no regulations nor major changes in the recreational fishery prior to 1999 that would suggest the need for an additional time block to aid in fitting these data. 


The fits to the ROV and CCFRP surveys did not change significantly with changes in selectivity patterns. The ROV lengths represent different areas in each of the years sampled. The ROV survey lengths were fit to the invidiual years of data and indicate an increase in mean size form 2019 to 2021 that was not captured by the model [@fig-meanlen-rov]. The CCFRP mean length was uncertain across years and the increased mean lenght in 2019 was not well  [@fig-meanlen-ccfrp]. The higher Pearson residuals for CCFRP in 2017, 2018 and 2024 around 30 cm are likley due to the fact that the Farallons were sampled in these years and have higher densities of quillback rockfish than other sites [@fig-len-pearson-all].

There are large Pearson residuals for the growth fleet conditional ages that may be due to ageing reading errors or the biased sampling for the data aggregated into the growth fleet [@fig-age-pearson-grow]. None of the data were excluded from the growth fleet.

#### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The first year of the recreational index was not fit, and may be contribued to it being the first year of the CRFS. The model fit the overall trend in the recreaitonal index reasonably well, and the change in time varying selectivity in 2017 is evident.

The relative indices from CCFRP and the ROV survey both indicated increases in the later years of the survey that the model fit underestimates. However, both indices were fit well withoutth need to add extra variation to capture changes.  The decreased value in 2019 for CCFRP was not captured by the model and may be a result of factors not considered in index development, i.e., higher than average catches of a midwater species.

### Population Trajectory

The population declined slowly with the onset of fishing, with three more significant annual declines in years of high catch [@tbl-timeseries,  @fig-ssb]. The population remained at lower levels from 1994--1999 before increasing from 2000--2007. Catches increase again in 2015 and result in a slightly declining population through 2023.  

The estimated spawning output relative to unfished reached a minimum of 0.328 in 1998 and then increased over the recent time period, with an ending year estimate of 0.428 in 2024 [@fig-depl].
