## Base Model Results (TOR section F and G) {#sec-base-results}

**FROG: Melissa, I think the time series of rec and recdev are better placed in the population trajectory section. I have the same figrues there, just commented out. Id suggested moving this first sentence to there. The largest contributor to the total likelihood is age composition data, followed by length compositions, then the survey and recruitment likelihoods.**

### Parameter Estimates (TOR section F2 and G1, G4, G5, H3)

A total of 121 parameters were estimated for the base model (@tbl-n-param). The parameter values, both fixed and estimated, along with approximate asymptotic standard errors of estimated parameters are shown in @tbl-pars and the overall likelihood components by data type are shown in @tbl-likelihood. Estimates of population size and spawning output relative to unfished over time are shown in @tbl-timeseries. 

The ln($R_0$) was estimated at `r round(mod_out$parameters['SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 3)`. The model estimated reasonable growth parameters and variability for 
$L_{age=1}$ = `r round(mod_out$parameters['L_at_Amin_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)` 
(CV = `r round(mod_out$parameters['CV_young_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`) and 
$L_{\infty}$ = `r round(mod_out$parameters['L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)` 
(CV = `r round(mod_out$parameters['CV_old_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`) cm.  The $k$ parameter was estimated as 
`r round(mod_out$parameters['VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1', 'Value'], 3)`. The estimated $L_{\infty}$ was 1.57 cm larger than the initial externally estimated fixed value, whereas the estimated $K$ value was smaller than the initial externally estimated fixed values. 

Length-based selectivity curves were estimated for the fishery and survey fleets, and length-based selectivity was fixed at 1.0 starting at age 1 for the growth fleet (@fig-selex). Model explorations included parameterizing the fleets with double normal selectivity and explorations of time blocks (see @sec-assmt-sens). The survey fleets did not include time blocks and the double normal selectivity patterns were fixed to reflect asymptotic selectivity. The ROV survey observed a wider range of sizes than CCFRP, though the he peak size for the ROV survey was estimated higher, at
`r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_ROV(5)', 'Value'], 3)` cm compared to 
`r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_CCFRP(4)', 'Value'], 3)` cm for CCFRP. The fishery selectivities were all estimated as asymptotic except for the early time period of the commercial fleet that estimated the peak domed selectivity at `r round(mod_out$parameters['Size_DblN_peak_CA_Commercial(1)_BLK1repl_1916', 'Value'], 3)`, indicating preferential size selection of smaller sized individuals during that period.

The catchability for each of the surveys was estimated comparing observed to expected vulnerable biomass across all years. Estimates are reported in Table [-@tbl-pars] in log-space. Analytical solutions for catchability to maintain a mean difference in observed versus expected of zero (described in Stock Synthesis as 'float Q') gave similar results but our preference was to include catchability as an estimated parameter. 

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in  Figures [-@fig-recruits] and [-@fig-rec-devs].  The strongest recruitment event occurred in 1994 and was followed by a period of lower than average recruitment until 2010, after which the recruitment pattern has been cyclical. Recruitment is estimated based on the spawner-recruit curve in 2024 (@fig-bh-curve). The early recruitment deviations were all negative.

### Fits to the Data (TOR section F3)

#### Fits to length and age composition

The aggregated fits to the length composition are reasonable (@fig-lenfit-all) given the overall sparseness of data and variable sample sizes by year (@fig-len-pearson-all).

 **FROG: data weighting results: Length compositions were down weighted for both catch fleets and both survey fleets.  Age composition data were down-weighted for the commercial catch fleet and the growth fleets.**

The mean lengths observed by year from the commercial fleet were uncertain but the time-varying selectivity captures the changes in mean length relatively well in all but the year 2007 (@fig-meanlen-comm). The commercial lengths samples from 2010--2014 only represent the two most northern ports, but there were not regulatory changes that supported the observed pattern in increasing length. There were limited ages available for the commercial fleet from a limited number of years. There are a few remaining large Pearson residuals in individual years, but the mean age from the conditional data were well captured by the model (@fig-age-pearson-comm and @fig-meanage-comm).

There were no ages available from the recreational fleet collected as part of the CDFW \gls{crfs} sampling program. The model fit the tails of the aggregated recreational length composition well, but expected a peak length larger than the data suggested (@fig-lenfit-all).  Recreational length data was fit well for years in which sample sizes were large. The Pearson residuals were variable by year and no patterns of general misfit were visible. The mean length in the recreational fishery was more uncertain prior to 1993 (@fig-meanlen-rec).  The mean length in 1983 was not fit with marked higher Pearson residuals for larger fish in the early 1980s.  There were no regulations nor major changes in the recreational fishery prior to 1999 that would suggest the need for an additional time block to aid in fitting these data. 

The fits to the ROV and CCFRP surveys did not change significantly with changes in selectivity patterns. The ROV lengths represent different areas in each of the years sampled. The ROV survey lengths were fit to the individual years of data and indicate an increase in mean size form 2019 to 2021 that was not captured by the model (@fig-meanlen-rov). The CCFRP mean length was uncertain across years and the increased mean length in 2019 was not well fit (@fig-meanlen-ccfrp). The higher Pearson residuals for CCFRP in 2017, 2018 and 2024 around 30 cm are likely due to sampling at the Farallons where higher densities of `r spp` are observed than at other sites (@fig-len-pearson-all).

Fits to conditional age-at-length data for the growth fleet are harder to evaluate, but generally seem acceptable (@fig-age-pearson-grow). There are large Pearson residuals for the growth fleet conditional ages that may be due to age reading errors or the biased sampling for the data aggregated into the growth fleet. Fits to the mean age over time (@fig-meanage-growth) showed no concerning patterns nor did plots of fit to mean age along with uncertainty (see figure in r4ss output).

#### Fits to Indices of Abundance

The first year of the recreational index was not fit, and this may be in part due to it being the first year of the survey (@fig-log-crfs-fit). The model fit the overall trend in the recreational index reasonably well, and the change in time varying selectivity in 2017 is evident.

The relative indices from the \gls{s-ccfrp} and the \gls{rov} surveys both indicated increases in the later years which model fits underestimated (@fig-log-ccfrp-fit and @fig-log-rov-fit). However, both indices were fit well without the need to add extra variation to capture changes.  The decreased value in 2019 for \gls{s-ccfrp} was not captured by the model and may be a result of factors not considered in index development, i.e., higher than average catches of a midwater species.

### Population Trajectory (TOR section G3) 

The population declined slowly with the onset of fishing, with three more significant annual declines in years of high catch (@tbl-timeseries,  @fig-ssb). The population remained at lower levels from 1994--1999 before increasing from 2000--2007. Catches increased again in 2015 and resulted in a slightly declining population through 2023.  

The estimated spawning output relative to unfished reached a minimum of 0.328 in 1998 and then increased over the recent time period, with an ending year estimate of 0.428 in 2024 [@fig-depl].
