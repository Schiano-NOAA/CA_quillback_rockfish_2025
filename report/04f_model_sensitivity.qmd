### Sensitivity Analyses {#sec-assmt-sens}

The base model contains substantial uncertainty in both how data were processed, and structural assumptions made. We tested sensitivity to many of these assumptions. Sensitivities were conducted as a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion unless specifically noted. In general, structural assumptions regarding population productivity led to the largest changes in model outputs [@fig-sens-overall]. All sensitivities with the exception of those related to omitting age or length data led to relatively similar estimates of growth parameters, indicating growth is consistently estimated in the model and we do not discuss it beyond sensitivities related to age and length data [@tbl-sens-productivity--@tbl-sens-selectivity]. We divide the sensitivities into four sections: population productivity, data weighting and relative contributions of data sources, how data are prepared, and selectivity. We also describe sensitivities done but not included in the document. 

#### Population Productivity

The base model makes a number of structural assumptions related to population productivity. These assumptions are known to be influential and drive how quickly a population will recover from fishing. In addition, new biological The following sensitivity models fall under population productivity:

-   Estimate $h$: Estimate steepness of the stock-recruit relationship.

-   Estimate $M$: Estimate natural mortality.

-   Estimate $M$ and $h$: Estimate both natural mortality and steepness of the stock-recruit relationship.

-   Recdevs in 1990: Turn off estimation of recruitment deviations until 1990, which corresponds roughly to when deviations become informative. 

-   No recdevs: Turn off estimation of recruitment deviations for all years, which assumes recruitment follows the stock recruitment curve. 

Structural assumptions in the model that determine population productivity, particularly natural mortality, were strongly influential on the population trajectory [@fig-sens-productivity, @tbl-sens-productivity]. Natural mortality was estimated to be around 0.08, whether steepness was also estimated or not, and resulted in a greater increase in recovery of the population in the 2000s, which led to a higher value for spawning output relative to unfished in 2025 that was outside the range of uncertainty from the base model. The improvement in total likelihood when estimating natural mortality or steepness was approximately one likelihood unit, with the greatest increase being when both parameters were estimated at 1.6 likelihood units.  Not estimating recruitment deviations resulted in increased spawning output for all years, but relatively more in recent years than in past years, resulting in higher spawning output relative to unfished in 2025 that was near to the range of uncertainty from the base model. Not estimating recruitment deviation led to degradation in fits to both length and age composition data, as well as in fits to indices, based on likelihood components. Starting recruitment deviations in 1990 led to modest degradation in model fit of around six likelihood units and resulted in little change in population trajectory. While the number of parameters saved would indicate this is a reasonable choice based on an information theoretic approach, we kept the start time for main recruitment deviations to be 1978. We did this to allow the early and initial main recruitment deviations to inform the size structure of the population, which given length composition data for the recreational fleet in 1980--1990 showing a large decline, along with a significant amount of total removals having occurred by 1990, would not be at equilibrium.  


#### Data Weighting and Contributions

The assessment model contains data from a variety of sources, some of which are expected to be more informative than others. Sampling units from these different data sources are not necessarily comparable (e.g., an observation from a survey index versus an observation of a fish length). Data weighting procedures are objective algorithms that can be used to assign weights to different data sources to optimize the fit of the model to the data. Increased uncertainty or emphasis factors also weight the relative contribution of datasets and can be used to influence contributions of various data types. The following sensitivity models fall under data weighting and contributions:

-   McAllister-Ianelli data weighting: Use the algorithm suggested by @mcallister_bayesian_1997 instead of @francis_data_2011

-   Dirichlet-multinomial data weighting: Apply the algorithm suggested by @thorson_model-based_2017 instead of @francis_data_2011

-   Extra SD: Estimate an extra standard deviation for all survey indices, which include the recreational, \gls{s-ccfrp}, and \gls{rov} indices. This allows each index to be down-weighted to allow for better fitting of other data sources.

-   Remove fleet lengths: Remove contributions from length composition data from the commercial and recreational fleet by setting the emphasis factors for these two elements to zero.

-   Remove conditional age at length: Remove contributions from conditional age at length data from the commercial and growth fleet by setting the emphasis factors for these two elements to zero. 

-   Remove indices: Remove contributions from index data for the recreational, \gls{s-ccfrp}, and \gls{rov} fleets by setting the emphasis factors for these three elements to zero. 

The model was robust to the range of alternative weighting and data contribution sensitivities, with the exception of exclusion of conditional age at length data [@fig-sens-contributions, @tbl-sens-contributions]. Excluding age data resulted in a higher estimate for equilibrium spawning output, and lower estimate for recent spawning output, due to reduced magnitude of recruitment deviations and higher $L_{\infty}$ and $K$, leading to lower values for spawning output relative to unfished. While excluding length data for the fleet also resulted in differing estimates of growth parameters, $L_{\infty}$ was estimated to be lower while $K$ higher than base model estimates, offsetting effects on the population trajectory, which was similar to that of the base model. Other sensitivity scenarios showed limited difference from the base model trajectory. While total likelihoods cannot be compared across scenarios, individual components of unchanged data types can be. When excluding age or length data contributions, survey likelihood components are similar to that of the base models. Similarly, when adjusting the contribution of survey data, age and length likelihood components are similar to that of the base model. This indicates that the survey indices provided limited signal relative to other data sources.


#### Data Choices

Compiling data for the assessment model required a number of choices and assumptions. The following sensitivity models fall under data choices:

-   Remove ageing error: assume no ageing imprecision when reading age samples.

-   Reduce large catches: catch estimates for the commercial fleet in 1991 and for the recreational fleet in 1984 and 1993 were particularly large compared to other years. Catch estimates in these years were assumed as averages from nearby years for this scenario. 

-   **FROG: Need to do** Smooth catches: catch estimates for the commercial fleet in 1991 and for the recreational fleet in 1984 and 1993 were particularly large compared to other years. However, some years could also be abnormally low compared to other years. For this model a five year average smoother (two years on either side) was applied for all years.

-   **FROG: Need to add if keep** Increase catch to make scale of absolute \gls{rov} abundance estimate from \gls{mpa} areas.

-   **FROG: Need to add if keep** Set natural mortality values to match the scale of the absolute \gls{rov} abundance estimate from \gls{mpa} areas. 

-   **FROG: Need to add if keep** Include the absolute \gls{rov} abundance estimate from \gls{mpa} areas as an absolute index of abundance. 

**FROG: Do we want the absolute abundance indices explorations as sensitivities or some other section or not at all?** 

**FROG: Discuss whether we need to a more detailed FAA description. The run we do here is not a strict sensitivity, but rather an exploration because the blocks are not refined and instead done without reducing parameters**

-   Areas-as-fleets: structure data for the recreational fleet following an areas-as-fleets approach [@punt_spatial_2019]. In this scneario data from northern districts (Redwood and Wine) were treated as a separate fleet from data from southern districts (all others). This applied to length composition data and indices. Only the recreational fleet was split because data was present in both areas across the time series, whereas for the commercial fleet length composition data in the south was sparse and present only in a few years outside of the 1990s while age composition data was only sampled in the north.  

**FROG: Prob need to talk more about catch scenarios. Though maybe that is best in uncertainties**

Choices around inclusion or exclusion of individual data or treatment of how to process and include in the model had generally limited effect on population trajectory and quantities [@fig-sens-data, @tbl-sens-data]. Estimates of spawning output in recent years are consistent across scenarios, but estimates of unfished spawning output vary, although they remain within the uncertainty bounds of the base model. When alternative catch streams were assumed, unfished spawning output declined, as expected. However, given consistent estimates of spawning output in recent years, lower estimates of unfished spawning output led to higher values for spawning output relative to unfished in 2025. The areas-as-fleets scenario resulted in generally similar trajectory to the base model, but with estimates for $L_{\infty}$ higher than the base and estimates for $K$ lower. The selectivity structure of the areas-as-fleets scenario was different from the base model, and allowed a greater number of blocks with the ability to estimate dome-shaped selectivity. The southern recreational fleet was estimated with dome-shaped selectivity whereas the norther fleet was asymptotic. This was done primarily because early explorations for areas-as-fleets showed poor fits, yet limited difference from the base model. The additional complexity, and nature of the commercial data being not ideal for a areas-as-fleets approach resulting in this method not being more greatly explored.

#### Selectivity 

There are many possible ways to parameterize selectivity in a stock assessment model, and its parameterization is generally a major source of structural uncertainty. Parameterization can relate to the number and years of selectivity blocks, where changes in length or age composition data is reflective of changes to the fishery as opposed to changes in the population, or the type of selectivity form, often either asymptotic or dome-shaped. The following sensitivity models fall under selectivity, with the first two dealing with both the number and year of blocks as well as the type of selectivity, and the remaining dealing with the type of selectivity: 

-   Full blocking of the recreational and commercial fleets, allowing for dome shaped selectivity. This scenario assumes the greatest number of blocks, and therefore parameters, among all the selectivity scenarios and was based on discussions with \gls{cdfw} staff and advisory panel members from the \gls{gmt} and \gls{gap}. Blocks for the commercial fleet were assumed for 1916--2002, 2003--2013, 2014--2021, and 2022--2024 (due to changes in bag limits and creation of the deeper nearshore permit as well as general depth restrictions in 2003, changes in depth limits for the northern port groups around 2014, and increased depth restrictions starting in 2022). Blocks for the recreational fleet were assumed for 1916--2000, 2001--2016, 2017--2022, and 2023--2024 (due to depth restrictions starting in 2001 and relaxation of those depth restrictions starting in 2017, ue to increase restrictions on harvest and retention of `r spp` starting in 2023).

-   Full blocking of the recreational fleet, allowing for dome shaped selectivity in all blocks except the first, which was assumed asymptotic. The first block was fixed as asymptotic because the estimated descending parameter (parameter 2) in the previous scenario was approximately asymptotic. Blocks for the commercial fleet matched the base model.

-   Selectivity allowed to be domed for all fleets, both catch and survey fleets, using the blocking structure from the base model. 

-   Selectivity allowed to be domed for all the commercial fleet using the blocking structure from the base model.

-   Selectivity allowed to be domed for all the recreational fleet using the blocking structure from the base model.

-   Selectivity allowed to be domed for survey fleets.

-   Selectivity assumed to be asymptotic for all fleets, both catch and survey fleets, using the blocking structure from the base model. 

-   Selectivity assumed to be asymptotic for all fleets and without any blocks for the catch fleets. 

Parameterization of selectivity, including the number and years of blocks, as well as the type of selectivity generally had limited effect on model trajectory [@fig-sens-selectivity, @tbl-sens-selectivity]. Simpler blocking designs were preferred over more complicated blocking designs based on information theory (i.e. \gls{aic}), and dome-shaped selectivity did not meaningfully improve model fit compared to asymptotic selectivity for nearly all blocks and fleets across scnearios [@tbl-sens-selectivity]. Nearly all scenarios were within the range of model uncertainty from the base model, with the exception of two scenarios. These two scenarios either allowed all selectivity types to be dome-shaped or applied a single selectivity block for the recreational and commercial fleets. For the dome-shaped scenario, although all fleets and blocks were allowed to be dome-shaped, further explorations showed that the combination of allowing dome-shape for the \gls{s-ccfrp} and recreational fleet contributed most to changes in spawning output relative to unfished. Model fit improved slightly when all fleets were allowed to be domed (slightly more than two likelihood units for six additional parameters), with the largest changes occurring when commercial and survey selectivity was allowed to be domed (individually these improved model fit by less than one likelihood unit). For the scenario without selectivity blocks, unfished spawning output was lower than the base model, though spawning output relative to unfished was generally comparable to the base model.


#### Sensitivities Not Included in Document

**FROG: Do we want this section? Could result in more questions than answers**

Many more explorations around data use and modeling choices were conducted but are not included in this report. Among data scenarios, using marginal age composition data for the commercial fleet instead of conditional age at length data, including length and conditional age at length compositions in years with sparse sample size (<5 for lengths and <30 for ages), excluding the most recent year of recreational length composition data given the difference in the operation of the fleet, excluding sample sizes less than 10 for commercial length composition data, and increase uncertainty in catch estimates all had minimal impacts on model outputs and are not included. Similarly, among selectivity scenarios, estimating a fourth parameter of the double-normal selectivity curve for all fleets prior to assuming asymptotic **FROG: Haven't done this. If keep need to do**, and alternative years for blocking the commercial fleet using 2018 instead of 2014 due to fully realizing increased access to deeper depths for southern port groups made throughout 2017, transferable deeper nearshore permits for 2018, and noticeable changes in mean sizes between 2017 and 2018) had minimal impacts on model outputs and are not included. Sensitivities around estimates of alternative values for longevity, or use of biological relationships from the 2021 assessment were also explored, but given these are shown elsewhere in the report via profiles or bridging, they are not duplicated in this section.
