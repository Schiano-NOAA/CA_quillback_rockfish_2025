### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices (TOR section F1 and E6)

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, with the goal of estimating a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off California. The base model represents a balance among the number of model parameters, the model fits to data, and minimizing the negative log-likelihood, as well as accurately representing fishery dynamics and `r spp` biology. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data, including new sources, to estimate reality.

Model specifications were informed by discussions with the \gls{pfmc}'s \gls{gmt} and \gls{gap} advisers and through comments and discussion during the [pre-assessment workshop](https://tinyurl.com/janpfmc2025). Choices related to model structure included a discussion of fleet structure, potential time blocks for selectivity parameters, the potential ability to estimate growth within the model. Data related choices on maximum age that is used to estimate natural mortality, and acknowledgement of years with high estimated catch were also discussed. These topics and more were explored through a series of investigative model runs to achieve the final base model, either through the bridging analysis (see @sec-bridging), through sensitivity analysis (see @sec-assmt-sens), or by profiles (see @sec-profiles).

The specifications of the assessment are listed in [@tbl-model-config]. Growth and natural mortality are assumed time- and sex-invariant. Population age and length structure is modeled from age 0 (recruitment age) to an accumulator age (plus group) of 80 in 1 year age bins, and from 4 cm (assumed size at birth at the beginning of the year) to an accumulator bin of 59 cm in 1 cm length bins. Data were binned in 1 year increments from 1 to 60 years for age, and in 2 cm increments from 10 to 50 cm for length. Growth is modeled using the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, with two estimated length parameters (length at age 1 and $L_{\infty}$), estimated CV for each length parameter, and a growth rate coefficient ($K$). Growth is assumed to be the same for males and females in this assessment. Year-class strength is estimated as deviations from a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, with deviations estimated between 1940--2024 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5.  

#### Conditional Age at Length Data

**FROG: We can remove this header if we want**

As described in the fishery-dependent data section (see @sec-fish-dep) age-frequency data from the commercial fleet and across many sources for the growth fleet were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by year. This approach has several benefits for analysis above the use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age that is usually controlled by the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also more reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, and that are quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, bias due to size-based selectivity and length-stratified ageing is avoided, and known sources of variation are included when estimating growth parameters.

### Model Parameters (TOR Section E6 and F1)

There are `r dplyr::filter(mod_out$parameters, Phase > 0) |> nrow()` estimated parameters in the base model. Estimated parameters include one parameter for $R0$, 5 parameters for growth, 97 recruitment parameters, 3 survey catchability parameters, and 15 selectivity parameters (@tbl-n-param and @tbl-pars). Early recruitment deviations are estimated starting in 1940, while main period recruitment deviations begin in 1978, shortly before the majority of length composition data become available, and end in 2021. Late recruitment deviations are estimated 2022--2024, and although forecast recruitment deviation parameters are included in @tbl-n-param, they were set to follow the stock-recruit curve. 

A number of parameters were fixed in the model. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, the mean of the prior. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.068 yr-1, the median of the prior as determined by the maximum age. Other biological parameters were also fixed, as described in the biology section (see @sec-biology), and include the two weight-length parameters, two maturity parameters, and two fecundity parameters. The assumed fraction of females in the population was also fixed, and assumed to be 0.5. The standard deviation of recruitment deviation $\sigma_R$ was fixed at 0.6.

**FROG: Move this to likelihood profiles. If already there delete it**
Likelihood profiles for natural mortality, as well as bivariate profiles with natural mortality and steepness, are described in section 4.6.3.  Sensitivities to natural  mortality are described in @sec-assmt-sens. When estimated, natural mortality was higher at 0.082 yr-1 but well within the prior distribution (SE = 0.31). This corresponds to a longevity of 66 years, which may be reasonable.  The consequences of alternative natural mortality values are also explored in the decision tables.  


#### Priors and Constraints on Parameters 

**FROG: We can remove this header if we want, but I think it helps break things up and I dont mind the extra header numbering**

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the @hamel_development_2022 meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 80 years. The prior assumed a log-normal distribution for natural mortality with a log-standard deviation of 0.31. The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with standard deviation of 0.16, as specified by the \gls{pfmc} \gls{tor}. Although there parameters were fixed in the base model, the likelihood component of the priors was included in the final likelihood.

Length and conditional-age-at-length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size for the composition data (see @sec-fish-dep), and where this input sample size is subsequently weighted to account for additional sources of over-dispersion according to the Francis method and using three iterations [@francis_data_2011; @tbl-compweight]. Each of the survey data sources are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with standard error provided as input for each index. Total removals are also assumed to follow a log-normal distribution but were given a fixed value of log-standard deviation of 0.05. 

Recruitment deviations during the main period were constrained to sum to zero. Relaxing this assumption showed some variation in the model, however, later explorations during sensitivities showed this be due to the timing of when main recruitment deviations start (see @sec-assmt-sens) and not due to the sum-to-one constraint. Given this, and because the constraint allows for clearer interpretation of management reference points, we keep it in the base model. 


#### Selectivity Assumptions  

**FROG: We can remove this header if we want, but I think it helps break things up and I dont mind the extra header numbering**

**FROG: Make sure the following two statements are stated somewhere here**
- All of these data sources use hook-and-line collection techniques and the selectivity was set at one for all ages. 

Time blocks on selectivity and selectivity forms were explored extensively when setting up the initial model structure.
Length-based selectivity curves represent the change in probability of capture with size. This results from the capabilities of the gear as well as a variety of other combined fishing and ecosystem dynamics that determine what sized fish a fleet has access to. California's fisheries are managed with depth and spatial restrictions that likely change afftec selectivity.  For `r spp`, we find that larger fish are present at all depths and smaller fish more commonly present in the shallower depths. This is evident in the ROV data and was also observed in British Columbia waters by @murie_comparative_1991. 

Time-varying selectivity was applied to both the commercial and recreational fleets using double normal curves.  Assumptions for the shapes of curves and timing of blocks was driven by a combination of model fits, likelihoods, and knowledge of fishery and regulatory dynamics over time.  Four time blocks for the commercial fleet allowed separate selectivity parameterizations during the periods 1916--2002, 2003--2013, 2014--2021, and 2022--2024.  The first of those four is allowed to be dome shaped by estimation of the peak, ascending width, and descending width parameters.  All other blocks estimate the peak and ascending width.  The early time period is inclusive of the 1980s and 1990s when the live rockfish fishery was most active and may have been targeting intermediate-sized fish. The periods between 2003--2013 and 2022--2024 were times of fishery restriction (@fig-com-regs-vis).  A variety of new depth limits, trip limits, and permit structures were implemented around 2003.  Trip limits were markedly reduced in 2022 and further limits specific to `r Spp` occurred in 2023 and 2024.  These periods are parameterized as asymptotic curves with a peak at relatively small sized fish that is similar to the peak of the early 1916--2002 period.  In contrast, the 2014-2021 period corresponds to modest increases in trip limits and allowable fishing depths.  This may have provided greater access to deeper waters where larger fish are prevalent, thus shifting the asymptotic curve's peak to the right. 

Two time periods were estimated for the recreational fleet.  These were 1916--2016 and 2017--2024.  During the period of 2000 to 2003, recreational depth and season restrictions were being implemented for nearshore rockfish the first time in California (@fig-rec-regs-vis).  However, explorations of time blocks before and after that period did not result in meaningfully different selectivity curves and we therefore modeled consistent selectivity before and after those regulatory changes.  The asymptotic peak for the initial block is shifted to the left towards smaller fish, perhaps corresponding to fishing dynamics in the very early years with anglers remaining relatively close to shore by choice or due to vessel capacity, as well as later years when they were restricted closer to shore through regulation. In contrast, the next block representing 2017-2024 is shifted to the right representing larger fish and most years during this period correspond to a period of regulatory relaxation.  

The selectivity parameters estimated for the later time blocks of commercial and recreational selectivity are also applied to future years during forecasts. Given that very recent restrictions in 2003 restricting data collection since that time, it is difficult to estimate selectivity parameters representative of that restricted period. It is also difficult to know what selectivity dynamics will look like in the coming years, i.e. whether they will be more similar to this recent restricted period or an earlier period.  

Asymptotic selectivity parameterizations were used for both survey fleets. The peak corresponds to selection of smaller fish for party/charter fleet relative to \gls{rov}. This is consistent with differences in survey depths with \gls{s-ccfrp} operating to only 60 m depth and \gls{rov} extending as deep as 100 m.  

Sensitivities to a variety of alternative selectivity curves and time blocks are presented in section @sec-assmt-sens.
