Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 50  < max pop len bins: 58; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Warning 2 : Final gradient: 0.0140554 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Warning 3 : poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.083332
Warning 4 : Fmsy/mey is >3x of Fspr are you sure?  check for convergence 
Note 2 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 8; check results, variance may be suspect
