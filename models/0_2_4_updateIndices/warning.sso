Warning 1 : catch is 0.0 in endyr; this can cause problem in the benchmark and forecast calculations. 
Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 50  < max pop len bins: 58; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 0.000408152; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 0.00122786 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Warning 5 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 2
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Warning 6 Adjustment: setting positive forecast relF for forecast only fleet: 2
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 3; check results, variance may be suspect
