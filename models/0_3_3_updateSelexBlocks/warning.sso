Warning 2 : Block:2 3 ends in: 2036 after retroyr+1:  2025
Warning 3 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 2.83558e-06; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 4 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 5 : Final gradient: 0.00207241 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 6; check results, variance may be suspect
