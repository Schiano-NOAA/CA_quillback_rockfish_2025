Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 50  < max pop len bins: 59; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 1 : At least one block pattern ends in endyr. Check the output parameter value time series to see if the values in forecast years are as intended.
Warning 2 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 4 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Note 2 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 1; check results, variance may be suspect
