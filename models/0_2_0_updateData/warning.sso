Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 50  < max pop len bins: 58; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 1 : 1st iteration warning: ssb(endyr)/ssb(styr)= 4.01211e-05; suggest start with larger R0 to get near 0.4; or use depletion fleet option
Warning 2 : 1st iteration warning: catch logL > 50% total logL; check configuration; suggest start with larger R0
Warning 3 : poor convergence in Fmsy, final dy/dy2= -0.0117047
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 2; check results, variance may be suspect
