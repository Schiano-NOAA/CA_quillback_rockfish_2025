<!-- Sensitivity to assumptions about model structure, i.e., model specification uncertainty.  -->

<!-- Sensitivity to data set choice (e.g., using emphasis factors to selectively remove data sources) and weighting schemes (e.g., MacAllister & Ianelli weighting versus Francis weighting vs. Dirichlet weighting for compositional data), which may also include a consideration of recent patterns in recruitment.  -->
