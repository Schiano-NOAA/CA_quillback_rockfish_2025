## Fishery-dependent data

### Total Removals {#removals}

Removals (1916--2024) for `r spp` were compiled from multiple data sources. This assessment uses total removals (landings plus dead discards) for all fishing fleets. Sources for total removals are described below. In instances where separate data sources were used for landings and dead discards, each component is described separately. The values for total removals used in the base model are provided in Table \ref{tab:catches1} and Figure \ref{fig:catches}.

#### Commercial Landings

Commercial landings for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live vs. dead. This choice was based on similarities in the length distributions among gear types and between fish landed live vs. dead within \gls{pacfin} samples.

Commercial landings data were available from 1916--2024. Historical landings (1916--1980) were obtained from the California Catch Reconstruction Project [@ralston_documentation_2010]. While all port groups were sampled, only the northern port groups of Crescent City, Eureka, and Fort Bragg had positive landings for `r spp`. Additional landings caught off the coast of Oregon or Washington but landed in California for 1948--1968 were added to the reconstruction to represent total landings at California ports. These additional landings were small in magnitude; no more than 0.08 mt was landed in any one year and approximately 0.3 mt was landed across all years. Landings for 1969--1980 came from \gls{calcom}, and were negligible for `r spp`. 

Recent (1981--2024) landings were obtained from \gls{pacfin} (extracted 03/14/2025). There were no landings for `r spp` within \gls{pacfin} in 1981--1983, and 1985. Sampling occurred during these years, and so estimates of zero were not due to a lack of sampling. Given that landings in the immediately preceding years were negligible, we kept landings for `r spp` in these years at zero, rather than interpolate based on neighboring values.


#### Commercial Discards

**FROG: Not sure we want this paragraph but this provides justification for our choice of adding dead discards to landings.**
Discarding can be modeled in multiple ways. Among West Coast assessments, three methods for modeling discards are commonly used. Either dead discards are added to landings to obtain total removals, dead discards are modeled as a separate fleet from the one based on landings, or dead discards are estimated through the use of a retention curve applied to the fleet based on landings. The first method assumes that discarded fish are similar to retained fish, whereas the later two options allow separate selectivity processes to operate on each discards and landings. Biological samples of `r spp` discards from \gls{wcgop} were available 2004--2022, but very sparse for all years other than 2022. Therefore, as there was limited information with which to estimate selectivity of the discards over the majority of years, we added dead discards to landings and modeled total removals. 

Commercial discard data for `r spp` are collected through NOAA's \gls{wcgop}. Estimates of dead discards in 2002--2023 for each sector of the commercial fleet are provided in the \gls{gemm} product [@somers_gemm_2023]. Dead discards from the \gls{gemm} product were added to landings estimates from the sources described above to obtain total removals for 2002--2023. Total removals prior to 2002, for which no \gls{wcgop} data are available, were calculated based on assuming an average ratio of dead discards to landings (0.25 percent), based on data from the nearshore sector in 2002--2021. The nearshore sector was selected as it most likely represents expected fishery behavior prior to 2002, and data from 2001 to 2021 were used because the ratio of dead discards increased in 2022 and 2023, likely as a consequence of management changes to the fishery. Preliminary estimates of dead discards for 2024 were provided by \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fos} program on 3/31/2025 and added to landings in that year to obtain total removals for 2024.   


#### Recreational Landings and Discards

Recreational landings data were available from 1928--2024. Historical landings (1928--1980) were obtained from the historical reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Since 1980, recreational data sources provide estimates of total removals, which combine landings and dead discards together. Data during these years were obtained from \gls{recfin} via the \gls{mrfss} (1981--2004) and \gls{crfs} (2005--2024) sampling programs. The \gls{mrfss} sampling program also includes removals for 1980, however because @ralston_documentation_2010 considered their 1980 estimate to be more reliable than that of \gls{mrfss}, and due to survey quality problems related to 1980 being the first year of \gls{mrfss} [@Karpov1995; @cope_status_2009], landings from the historical reconstruction were preferred for 1980. Estimates of dead discards for the historical years (1928--1980) were calculated based on an average ratio of dead discards to landings (1.1 percent) from \gls{mrfss} data across all years 1980--2004. A direct breakdown of the landed and dead discarded fish by weight was not available within the \gls{mrfss} data, so the proportion by number of total dead catch that was unavailable to the sampler, which included dead discarded fish, was calculated (\gls{mrfss} column ESTHARV divided by the sum of columns ESTHARV and ESTCLAIM) and used to derive the ratio. Landings and dead discards for the historical years were then added together to obtain estimates of total removals. 

A number of years with missing or incomplete estimates for recreational total removals were filled in. First, 207 \gls{crfs} catch records in \gls{recfin} between 2014--2022 had a zero estimate for dead discards by weight but not by number. Catches were based on weight, so to ensure these records were included, an average weight per fish for dead discards was calculated from records with both weight and number, and used to derive estimates of dead discards in weight. Filling in these gaps increased the estimated total removals from between 0.02 mt to at most 1.2 mt in any one year. Second, the \gls{mrfss} sampling program did not sample between 1990--1992, and did not sample the party/charter (PC) mode north of San Luis Obispo between 1993--1995. Estimates for PC mode in 1993--1995 were calculated as the average of PC removals among \gls{mrfss} years (1980--2004) and then added to the private/rental (PR) mode estimates in 1993--1995 to obtain total removals for those years. Estimates of total removals for both the PR and PC modes in 1990--1992 were obtained as averages from neighboring years. Total removals in 1990 were estimated as the average of total removals from 1987--1989, total removals in 1991 as the average from 1987--1989 and 1993--1995, and total removals in 1992 as the average from 1993--1995. Estimate of total recreational removals in 1993 were some of the largest for the recreational fleet across all years. The effects of assuming an average catch in 1991 and 1992 based on the 1993 estimate was explored through sensitivity analyses (see @sec-assmt-sens). 

**FROG: THIS SECTION IS A HOLDOVER FROM THE LAST ASSESSMENT. DO WE WANT TO KEEP? IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE RESULTS. IF KEEP ADD A SECTION FOR COMMERCIAL**
The recreational fishery is the main source of mortality for quillback rockfish in California (Table 1 and Figure 1). Recreational removals peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with two years of exceptionally large catches in 1984 and 1993. Removals declined sharply in 1994, but increased to levels similar to the late 1970s and early 1980s in the mid 2000s and again in recent years.
